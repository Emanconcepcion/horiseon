          The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching
          for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at
          home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your

        <!-- changed P to blockquote -->
        <blockquote>
          The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social
          media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they
          want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the
          control over what potential customers see when they search for your
          business.
